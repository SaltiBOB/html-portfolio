<h1>The Best Movie Rankings According to Duard </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Blade Runner (1982)</h3>
<p>I've always loved old movies,one's that were considered as "classics". What makes Blade Runner special to me is the way they rendered the world in which the story takes place,I found it to be stunningly dark and beautiful.</p>
<h3>The Batman (2022)</h3>
<p>There are many versions of Batman told in movies over the years,whether through animation or live action. But what made this telling of Batman special was that they got the fear element of Batman and his detective skills which you hardly see in other movies, right for once. To us Batman is a superhero but to the criminals of Gotham he is a boogyman hiding in the shaddows who will catch you for your crimes no matter how well you hide.</p>
<h3>Treasure Planet</h3>
<p>This was my all time favourite movie as a kid,the entire out of this world theme of rocket propelled sail ships cruising throught the stars took my imagination for a ride.Treasure planet is a movie I will enjoy even now as an adult and I recommend it to anyone who hasin't seen it. </p>
